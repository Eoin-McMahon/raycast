# ðŸ’¡ Raycast


* A python raycasting demo using p5py
* This is a port based off of the javascript implementation shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&t=1708s
* This should be (it isn't because unlike p5js, its not built ontop of the skia engine) more performant however than the video, I noticed there were a number of duplicate heavy calculations being made in the video which have been fixed here.
